I would have completed parts 4 and 5 if I didn't have to manually write down the coordinates of all the non-standard 
tiles. As they are optional, and I decided that going through them was less interesting than implementing 
bounding and heuristics, I did that instead. 

Note that there is a testing module that validates the code.
